## Introduction

The launch and rise of TikTok throughout these past few years have been eminent, which caused a lot of shifts in advertising methods today. As social media preferences shift from Instagram to TikTok, advertisements quickly shifted too. To adjust to this change, the beauty industry broke away from traditional approaches such as advertising exclusivity to pushing out more relatable content (linkedin). Therefore, we want to analyze the differences between global ambassadors and relatable influencers that we see on TikTok and see what their impacts to the brand is. Seeing this gradual change influenced our project question: Are L’Oreal ambassadors worth it? We decided to focus on L’Oreal specifically because it is the world’s biggest cosmetic company in terms of revenue (cosmetic-technology). 
## Plan For Acomplishing your goals
- Clean data set(s) that we will be using
- Create regression models(we plan to use mainly linear regression) to look for trends in the effects of L'Oreals ambassadors on their companies profits
- Our regression models will focus on predicting the financial benefits or drawbacks of running campaigns with ambassadors
- Analyze how brands performed before their ambassadors campaigns and how the perform after
- Account for variables that may effect the economic trends at the time
